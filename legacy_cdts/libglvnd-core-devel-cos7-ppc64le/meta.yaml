  summary: (CDT) Core development files for libglvnd
  description: |
    The libglvnd-core-devel package is a bootstrap trick for Mesa, which wants to
    build against the libglvnd headers but does not link against any of its
    libraries (and, initially, has file conflicts with them). If you are not Mesa
    you almost certainly want libglvnd-devel instead.
