  summary: (CDT) Soup, an HTTP library implementation
  description: |
    Libsoup is an HTTP library implementation in C. It was originally part of a
    SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation called Soup, but the SOAP
    and non-SOAP parts have now been split into separate packages.  libsoup uses
    the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK applications. This
    enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers on the network in a
    completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to the Gtk+ programming model (a
    synchronous operation mode is also supported for those who want it).
